       Yes, yes, okay, well, my name in May-Lyn. I'm from China, my father was enlisted in the war, and he's ill, so I took his place, and now im stuck here. 
       I'm supposed to be a guard, but they don't know that I knocked out the last one, and took his place... They're going to kill me if they find out.
